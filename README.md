# ios movie app

## This app is a way for users to see which movies are currently playing in theaters as well as movies that were recently in theaters.
### The app is an expansion upon a movie app that I created in the CodePath iOS development course

### How it was made
- The Movie Database API used to retrive movies and their information while a webview is used to play movie trailers.
- The only pod used in this project is AlamofireImage
